# homebrew-utils

Homebrew tap for miscellaneous utilities.

## Installation

Assuming you already have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can use this tap via the following terminal command:
```
brew tap gwinstanley/utils
```
and then you can install its formulae as usual (```brew install gwinstanley/utils/<formula>```), and they should show up in formula searches (```brew search <formula>```).
